## Getting Started

This project is created with A frame. 

### House plan and static model

A frame doesn't provide a convienet tool for 3d model editing. To create a room (with floor, wall, and ceiling) I used a tool named Sweet Home 3D [Link](http://www.sweethome3d.com/download.jsp/). This is a 3d modeling tool that designed for create floor plan.

For the static furniture (without animation), I integrated them in to the room and imported them as a single object in this way the code in A frame would be cleaner to read.
